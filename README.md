# Hello-World
My very first repository!
I wonder which coding language I'm supposed to use
I'm trying to make a break into the larger world of IT. I landed my very first technical support job in Feb 2019 and I'm just learning basic networking and troubleshooting for secuirty equipment installers.  We also beta test new and exciting devices before launch. I'm starting my own github account as my sandbox entry into coding for fun and education.  I'm looking forward to continuing my journey!
